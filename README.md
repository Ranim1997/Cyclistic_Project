# Cyclistic's Bike Share Project (Case Study)
The project conducted on Cyclistic's bike share data for [Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/programs/saudi-digital-academy-nsgrx/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone?authProvider=nelc&source=search). The repositry include the code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps. Also, the documentation for data analysis steps: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act**.
## Project Scenario 
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to **convert casual riders into annual members**. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

The Question is **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

## Data 
The data for the period from Sept till Nov 2023 used for this casestudy. The data available [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

## Ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act
Please refer to this repositry files for more details and [full documentation](https://github.com/Ranim1997/Cyclistic_Project/blob/main/Cyclistic_Summary.Rmd).

## Conclustion
As conclusion for this data analysis for 3 months data and comparing casual and members behaviour, the findings are:
1.	The percentage of member riders is higher than the casual riders.
2.	Casual riders are using the app more in the weekends, while members in the weekdays
3.	September is the highest for both type of riders, while November is the lowest.
4.	Classic bikes are used more than the electric bike for both type of riders.
5.	On average casual riders drive for longer distance than members.

## Recommendations
Based on my analysis, to convert casual riders into members, the top four recommendations are:
1. Offer benefits exclusive for members, especially on weekends and summer, so casual riders will be encouraged to be annual member.
2. Casual riders tend to drive for longer distance than members, so introducing some type of benefit related to driving longer distance, but it is only active if they are an annual member.
3. Focus on maintaining the classic bike since it is the favourite option for both memberships.
4. flexible plans like “on weekends” or “Summer only” will be a starting point to attract more people to use the bike share more often, thus, they may be interested in moving to annual plan.
